# XinputReader
Use XInput python library with Blender for gamepad controls!

Install the XInput library via pip using the button in the add-on preferences.
Toggle system console to check if it succeeded or errored. If you see a lot of red, you'll need to run Blender as an administrator.
If you still see red, try downloading a portable version of Blender.

Runs as a modal operator so take care with lack of auto-saves!!
